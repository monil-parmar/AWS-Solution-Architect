# AWS Solution Architect Project  
### Case Project: Designing and Deploying Scalable AWS Architectures  

## Overview  
This project showcases a series of **hands-on labs and challenge-based activities** completed during the **Amazon AWS II â€“ Solution Architect** course. The exercises simulate real-world architecture design and implementation tasks using various AWS services and best practices.

## Objective  
To build and deploy secure, scalable, and highly available solutions on AWS by implementing infrastructure automation, decoupled architectures, hybrid storage, and serverless applications. These activities align with the competencies expected of an **AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate**.

## Scenario  
As a cloud solution architect-in-training, I designed and tested full-stack AWS solutions across multiple labs. These included networking, compute, storage, serverless, automation, and application deployment scenariosâ€”all intended to mirror real-world production challenges.

## Activities & Labs Covered  

### IAM and Security  
- Managing users, groups, and policies in AWS IAM  
- Implementing secure access control for AWS services  

### Storage & File Systems  
- Creating and mounting **Amazon EFS**  
- Implementing **Amazon S3** cross-region replication  
- Hybrid storage using **AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway**  

### Compute and Databases  
- Launching EC2 instances and RDS database instances  
- Connecting web apps to RDS  
- Scaling compute with Auto Scaling Groups and Load Balancers  

### Networking  
- Designing and configuring **Amazon VPC**  
- VPC peering, subnets, route tables, flow logs  

### Infrastructure as Code  
- Automating deployments using **AWS CloudFormation**  
- Updating stacks and visualizing templates  

### Decoupled & Serverless Architectures  
- Integrating **Amazon SQS** and **SNS**  
- Creating Lambda functions and S3 event triggers  
- Building fully serverless pipelines with notifications  

### Challenge Labs (Capstone Tasks)  
- Static and dynamic website deployment  
- Scalable and highly available architecture for a cafÃ© scenario  
- Serverless architecture implementation  
- Full VPC and networking configuration
